## Functional Programming

Functional Programming : The program consists entirely of functions. Even the main program is a function, which receives input as an argument and generates output as its result.

**INPUT X ---> [FUNCTION F] ---> OUTPUT X**

- It is able to treat functions as first-class objects.
- It is able to pass functions as arguments.
- It is able to control flow using functions, recursions and arrays.
- It is able to use pure, recursive, higher-order, closure and anonymous functions.
- It is able to use helper functions, such as map, filter and reduce.
- It is able to chain functions together.
- The state doesn’t change (i.e. it’s immutable).
- The order of code execution is not important.

## Functional Programming in React

In React, everything in user Interface is a component. The components put together can create other components. So the application is itself is a component.

- Functional programming allows us to write cleaner and more modular code. By writing smaller and simpler functions that are isolated in scope and logic, we can make code much easier to test, maintain and debug.

- Now these smaller functions become reusable code, and that allows you to write less code, and less code is a good thing.

- The functions can be copied and pasted anywhere without any modification. Functions that are isolated in scope and that perform only one task will depend less on other modules in an app, and this reduced coupling is another benefit of functional programming.
